This plugin is used to send events to Filebeat so that it can forward
the event to logstash or elasticsearch.

Installation / Configuration Filebeat
-------------------------------------

Install filebeat
================

  The quick start installation for ``filebeat`` can be found `here <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation-configuration.html>`_

  The following is the example for RPM-based systems.

  ::

    curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-7.9.2-x86_64.rpm
    rpm -vi filebeat-7.9.2-x86_64.rpm

Configure filebeat
==================

There are two modes of operation of the filebeat plugin.  The first
mode, ``file``, is the original method for transferring events to
filebeat from the filebeat plugin.  The other method, ``tcp``, uses
tcp sockets to send messages.

Regardless of mode, you will need to configure your output section.  See the
*logstash* or *elasticsearch* as needed.

file mode
+++++++++

Inside the /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml file, you will need to add
a filebeat.inputs stanza.

This looks like:

  ::

    - type: log
      paths:
      - /var/log/filebeat-plugin/json.log
      fields:
        drp_id: test1
      fields_under_root: true
      json.keys_under_root: true

The two parts that the user needs to configure are hte filename of the intermediate logging file.  Also,
it is helpful to add a field to the event that indicates which DRP endpoint the event came from.  This is done
by changing ``test1`` to the DRP endpoint id.

tcp mode
++++++++

Inside the /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml file.  You will need to
add a filebeat.inputs stanza.

  ::

    - type: tcp
      enabled: true
      host: "127.0.0.1:9000"
      max_message_size: 10MiB
      fields:
        drp_id: test1
      fields_under_root: true
      json.keys_under_root: true

Additionally, a couple processors needs to be added to handle the JSON conversion.  The log directory already
handles this.

  ::

    - decode_json_fields:
        fields: ["message"]
        process_array: false
        max_depth: 1
        target: ""
        overwrite_keys: true
        add_error_key: true
    - drop_fields:
        fields:
          - message

These processors cause the system to convert the TCP message data into a json blob stored at the top of the event
and drop the ``message`` field to remove duplicate data.


Configuration DRP Filebeat Plugin
---------------------------------

The default plugin for the ``filebeat`` plugin will use the ``file`` mode with a filename of
``/var/log/filebeat-plugin/filebeat.json``.  This plugin will be added automatically on startup if not already created.
These are the defaults for the starting system.

If the path needs to be changed, add the ``filebeat/path`` parameter to match the input file path in the filebeat yaml
file.

To change modes, add the ``filebeat/mode`` parameter to the plugin and set it to ``tcp``.  The default is ``file``.

In ``tcp`` mode, the default tcp connection string is ``127.0.0.1:9000``.  This should match the ``tcp`` filebeat input
stanza exactly.
