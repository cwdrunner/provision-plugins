Endpoint Exec
-------------

Endpoint Exec (endpoint-exe) provides the ability to execute some restricted commands on the DRP Enpdoint on behalf of the machine.

The machine would execute a task that does a "runaction" that triggers the command and it returns the result of that command.

The result is sent through as a JSON blob.

  ::

    {
      "ReturnCode": 0,
      "StandardOut": "standard out of command",
      "StandardErr": "standard err of command"
    }


The command is specified by the "endpoint-exec/action" parameter.  Additional command line args can be sent by setting the
"endpoint-exec/parameters" parameter.

The plugin requires those actions map to a structure in the plugin parameter, endpoint-exec/actions.

That structure looks like this:

  ::

    {
      "my-command": {
        "Path": "/path/to/command.py",
        "BaseArgs": "arg1 arg2"
      }
    }


Path defines the path to the command to execute.  It should be an absolute path.

BaseArgs defines additional arguments for that command.  This is optional.
