Description: The groupid of the path to put the AWX / Tower ssh keys
Documentation: |
  This parameter specifies the groupid to use for the AWX / Tower ssh keys.

  This is used with the tower/ssh-keys, tower/ssh-keys-path, and tower/ssh-keys-path-userid parameters.

  The set of parameters is used to create additional ssh keys that AWX / Tower can use
  to access the system beyond the normal root ssh keys.

  The userid and groupid parameters define the user and group for the files.  The ssh-keys-path
  parameter defines the path to the key file (including filename).  The ssh-keys parameter defines
  the set of keys to put in place.
