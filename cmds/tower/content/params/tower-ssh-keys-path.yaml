Description: The path to put the AWX / Tower ssh keys
Documentation: |
  This parameter specifies the path (including filename) to place the AWX / Tower ssh-keys.

  This is used with the tower/ssh-keys-path-userid, tower/ssh-keys-path, and tower/ssh-keys-path-groupid parameters.

  The set of parameters is used to create additional ssh keys that AWX / Tower can use
  to access the system beyond the normal root ssh keys.

  The userid and groupid parameters define the user and group for the files.  The ssh-keys-path
  parameter defines the path to the key file (including filename).  The ssh-keys parameter defines
  the set of keys to put in place.
