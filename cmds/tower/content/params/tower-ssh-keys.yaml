Name: "tower/ssh-keys"
Description: "A map of ssh public keys to install for the tower-key-path"
Documentation: |
  This map is used to put ssh public keys in place the toker-key-path

  The key of the map is a arbritary name and the value is the ssh
  public key for that name.

  This is used with the tower/ssh-keys-path-userid, tower/ssh-keys-path, and tower/ssh-keys-path-groupid parameters.

  The set of parameters is used to create additional ssh keys that AWX / Tower can use
  to access the system beyond the normal root ssh keys.

  The userid and groupid parameters define the user and group for the files.  The ssh-keys-path
  parameter defines the path to the key file (including filename).  The ssh-keys parameter defines
  the set of keys to put in place.
