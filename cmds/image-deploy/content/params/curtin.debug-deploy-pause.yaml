Description: "Enable debug pause for curtin deploy"
Documentation: |
  If set to ``true``, then the ``curtin-deploy`` task will pause for
  debugging the deployment environment.  The pause will last a total
  of 30 minutes, after which provisioning will continue.

  To force return to normal operation, remove the control file, and the
  pause loop will escape; continuing provisioning.

    * ``rm -f /tmp/curtin-debug-pause-deploy``
