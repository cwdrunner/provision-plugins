Name: esxi/patch-list
Description: "Array of patches to apply to ESXi, specified by VMware Build Number"
Documentation: |
  THIS IS A CONSTRUCTED VALUE.  It should not be set on the machine.
  It will get overwritten by the ``esxi-set-patch-list`` task.

  Defines the VMware patches that will be applied to the system.  This value
  can be programmatically built up any number of ways.  Currently, the
  ``vmware/esxi-version-vendor-map`` in use on the machine may optionally
  carry the ``patches`` data structure.  If patches are specified there, then
  this Param will be built up with the list from that structure.

  If an operator wishes to completely override the programmatic build up of the
  patch list, use the ``esxi/patch-list-override``.

  In both cases, the ``esxi/patch-map`` must contain a map for the specified
  patches to be applied with appropriate values.

  Pathces are applied in order.  For each patch that specifies a ``reboot-required: true``,
  the system will be rebooted before applying the next patch set.  If not set to ``true``,
  then patches will be applied until the next required reboot is specified.
