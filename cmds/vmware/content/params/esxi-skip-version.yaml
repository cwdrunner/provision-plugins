Documentation: |
  This Param lets the operator skip the version call back to the DRP
  endpoint during kickstart installation.  It is used to get the DRP
  version info and inject it in to the DCUI screen for identify
  verification purposes on a built DRP endpoint.

  This option is primarily intended for debugging kickstart components
  that are rendered to the machine via DRP's templating system.
