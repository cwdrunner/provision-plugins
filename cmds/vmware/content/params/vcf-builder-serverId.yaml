Name: "vcf-builder/serverId"
Description: "vCF Builder cluster server ID string"
Documentation: |
  The ESXi server ID string in the cluster.  By default the DRP
  Machine UUID will be used as the serverId.

  If you choose to set a different value than this default behavior,
  then you will have to apply it as an individual Param (or as a
  different Profile from the ``vcf-builder-cluster-profile`` defined
  profile) on the given Machine.

  .. note: **WARNING**: You can NOT set the value in the
    ``vcf-builder-cluster-profile`` as that profile is set on every machine
    in the cluster, the value *MUST* be unique to each ESXi instance.

Schema:
  type: "string"
Meta:
  color: "yellow"
  icon: "cloud"
  title: "RackN Content"
  render: "profile"
