Description: Set the Frame MTU size ("jumbo" frames) for the Management Network vswitch.
Documentation: |
  Sets the MTU frame size ("jumbo" frames) for the installed ESXi instance on
  first boot for the Management Network vSwitch (typically ``vSwitch0``).

  Valid values as defined by VMware for this field are from ``1000`` to ``9999``.

  Typically the system default is 1500 bytes. This value may be set larger in
  environments using large frames (aka "jumbo"), which typically are a value
  close to 9000 bytes.  In some virtualized environments where additional layers
  of overhead for encapsulation are needed, the packet may be larger than 9000
  bytes.
