Name: esxi/drpy-agent-log
Description: "Defines where the DRPY Agent output will log to."
Documentation: |
  The ESXi RackN Agent (runner) is called "DRPY".  When it runs, it
  will produce **stdout** and **stderr** log information.  This Param
  defines where this log lives on the system.

  Setting this value will completely override the in-built default
  location which is:

    * ``_esxi/install-datastore_/rackn/drpy.log``

  This is not defined with a default value as we use the above Param
  (_esxi/install-datastore_) as a base for the path.
