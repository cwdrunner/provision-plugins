Name: "esxi/patch-map"
Description: "Mapping of VMware Build Number to artifacts for patch install."
Documentation: |
  This Param allows an operator to create a list of VMware ESXi patches by
  Build Number mapped to the locations of the patch.  An operator specifies
  which patch to apply to a system with the ``esxi/patches-to-apply`` Param
  which is a Build Number reference in to this data structure.

  *NOTES:*

    * "build-number" - referes to the VMware build number assigned to the patch release
    * "filename" - used if the "location" is not set, then ``esxi/patch-mirror`` plus this value is used
    * "reboot-required" - specify if this patch requires a reboot of the system
    * "checksum" - specify the checksump **type** (md5, sha1, or sha254), and value of the checksum type
    * "location" - if this patch not located at ``esxi/patch-mirror`` location, specify alternate location (``filename`` will be appended)
    * "reference-url" - reference documentation and/or download url to get more inforamtion about the patch

  The VMware website to search for patches is located at:
    * https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/patch#search

  Most patches download URLs will be found via the Patch Search link above. Do to how VMware stages
  patch updates for download on their website, it is not possible to provide a direct download reference
  link.
