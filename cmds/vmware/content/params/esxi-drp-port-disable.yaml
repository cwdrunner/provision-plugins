Name: esxi/drp-port-disable
Description: Set the ESXi firewall to disable outbound access to DRP API service.
Documentation: |
  For installation of ESXi to succeed, the Machine being installed must be able
  to reach the DRP API service port.  This allows for some Python hackery to
  notify DRP to set the Machine to boot local disk, and other actions.

  Once the Machine has been installed, it is possible to disable the outbound
  open port access in the ``firstboot`` section.  Doing so will disable the
  ESXi instance from being able to communicate with the ``dr-provision`` API
  service unless the port is opened again.

  You can manually enable/disable the API service port access with the following
  ``esxcli`` (or equivalent ``localcli``) command:

    ::

      esxcli network firewall ruleset set --ruleset-id=dr-provision --enabled=true

  Set the ``true`` state to ``false`` to disable the port access.
