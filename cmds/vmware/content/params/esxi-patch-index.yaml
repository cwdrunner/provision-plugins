Name: esxi/patch-index
Descriptio: The index of the patch to apply currently.
Documentation: |
  This string variable is used to track the index of the patch to apply.
  This allows machine to track position across reboots.

  The parameter is a string because we don't have great tools for the esxi
  environment yet and should be cast to an integer when being used.

  The default value is -1 to indicate uninitialized.
