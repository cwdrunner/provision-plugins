Name: esxi/acceptance-level
Description: Set the ESXi software install acceptance level.
Documentation: |
  Setting this param and running the task ``esxi-acceptance-level`` will set the
  ESXi node software VIB install acceptance level.  NOTE that as per VMware defined
  policies and behavior, you may NOT set the acceptance level to a level any
  higher than the lowest level install software VIB package.

  Currently, the RackN DRP-Agent and DRP-Firewall-Ruleset VIBs require that the
  acceptance level be set at ``CommunitySupported``.  If these components are
  installed (as they are by default) you will not be able to raise the level.

  The default value is ``CommunitySupported``.  The supported values are (from
  highest to lowest):

    * VMwareCertified
    * VMwareAccepted
    * PartnerSupported
    * CommunitySupported
