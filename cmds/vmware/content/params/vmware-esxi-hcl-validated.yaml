  Once the VMware ESXi Compatibility Checker has been completed, this
  Param will contain the results of the check.  If the machine is
  marked ``compatible`` by the VMware tools, then the value will be
  set to ``True`` otherwise, it's ``False``

  If ``True`` then it is implied the machine is compliant with the HCL.

  Note that both this Param and ``vmware/esxi-hcl-completed`` should
  be set to ``True`` to ensure that the tooling ran, and the machine
  passed validation.

  However, in DevTest situations, you may set the value to ``True`` to
  allow for subsequent installers to complete successfully, regardless
  of the actual HCL compatibility check results.
Schema:
  type: "boolean"
  default: false
Secure: false
