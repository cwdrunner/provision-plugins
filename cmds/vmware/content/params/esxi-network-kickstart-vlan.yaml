Name: esxi/network-kickstart-vlan
Description: Set the VLAN ID for the Kickstart installation.
Documentation: |
  Sets the VLAN tag ID (VLANID) for the kickstart installation network
  settings.

  Note that there are three possible places you may want/need to set a
  VLANID:

    1. At PXE boot time for the kernel - use ``kernel-options`` and ``vlanid=N`` syntax
    2. During the installation phase in the kickstart process - use the Param ``esxi/network-kickstart-vlan``
    3. After final reboot, to transition to a "production" or similar network, use the Param ``esxi/network-firstboot-vlan``

  In many cases, the provisioning network may or may not be a VLAN tagged
  network, which may very likely be different from the final installed
  ESXi production use case network configuration.  On ``firstboot`, you
  can specify values separately from the installation phases to support
  network transitions from install to production use.

  If you set a different value for the ``firstboot`` stage VLANID, you
  must also insure the network settings are correctly reflected for the
  new VLAN.  Your options are to use DHCP or Manual modes in this case
  (see ``esxi/network-type`` Param).  Convert would not be correct in
  this case as the provisioning network is likely to not be the same
  IP address space as a production network when changing VLANIDs.

  Valid values as defined by VMware for this field are from ``1`` to ``4095``.
