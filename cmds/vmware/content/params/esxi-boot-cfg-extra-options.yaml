Description: Add optional boot.cfg key value pairs
Documentation: |
  If specified, sets additional ``key=value`` pairs to be injected in to
  the ESXi ``boot.cfg`` file.  The boot configuration file used by ESXi
  sets simple text based keys and associated values to control the
  installation options from the ISO contents.

  It may be necessary to add additional boot key and value pairs in the
  ``boot.cfg`` template for a system to successfully install on a given
  platform.  This Param can be used to add in extra options to the file.

  To use it, simply set the Param string value to appropriate key and
  value pairs, separate by newlines, like:

    ::

      key1=value1
      key2=value2

  **IT IS IMPORTANT** that you insert a newline between ``key=value``
  pairs.
