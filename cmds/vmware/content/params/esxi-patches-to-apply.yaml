Description: "Array of patches to apply to ESXi, specified by VMware Build Number"
Documentation: |
  Defines the VMware patches to apply, in order, to the ESXi system.  The patch(es)
  must be specified by the VMware reference Build Number, which has an entry
  defined in the ``esxi/patch-map`` map.

  Pathces are applied in order.  For each patch that specifies a ``reboot-required: true``,
  the system will be rebooted before applying the next patch set.  If not set to ``true``,
  then patches will be applied until the next required reboot is specified.
