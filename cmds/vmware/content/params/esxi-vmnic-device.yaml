Name: esxi/vmnic-device
Description: ESXi network device name for the initial network configuration
Documentation: |
  Use this param to specify the device to plumb the network configuration up
  with post install.  By default we assume "vmnic0", however, this may not
  be correct.  This param allows the operator to override the defined NIC
  for the installed OS.

  It is possible the Classify content can be used to identify the machine
  devices to set the Param on the machine for the correct NIC name.
