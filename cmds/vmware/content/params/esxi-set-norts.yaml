Name: esxi/set-norts
Description:  Enables the ESXi boot value for norts set to 1, needed for some processor architectures.
Documentation: |
  If set to ``true``, then the template ``boot.cfg`` file will add the ``norts=1`` option
  to the boot flags.

  This is required for some hardware platforms, typically due to processor differences.  For example,
  some Lenovo systems with Skylake processors.  The flag disables the UEFI runtime support.  Note
  that other hardware systems may also require this value.  Some errors you may see in the middle
  of the ESXi Weasel Kickstart installer on the systems console:

    - ``Shutting down firmware services...``
    - ``Using 'simple offset' UEFI RTS mapping policy``

  By default, the value will not be added to the ``boot.cfg`` tempalte.
