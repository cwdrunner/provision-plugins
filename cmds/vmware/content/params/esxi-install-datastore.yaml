Name: esxi/install-datastore
Description: "Set the installed datastore location on ESXi"
Documentation: |
  This location defines the ESXi datastore that will be used for
  storing install logs, RackN related status files and information,
  and the scratch partition that will be used.

  By default that location will be on the first found (install) disk
  and default to:

    * /vmfs/volumes/datastore1

  It's important to note that this location will contain all copies
  of the Weasel kickstart install logs, artifacts that RackN needs
  for installation/reference, and the scratch partition.
