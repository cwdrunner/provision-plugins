Name: esxi/skip-notify
Description: "**WARNING** Skip the 'notify' back to DRP to set bootenv to local."
Documentation: |
  This Param lets the operator skip the notification back to the DRP
  endpoint during kickstart installation, to set the ``bootenv`` to
  boot from ``local`` disk.

  .. note: **WARNING** This option means that on install success and
    reboot, the ESXi node will re-start a new PXE install, unless you
    intervene to set the ``bootenv`` to ``local``.

  This option is primarily intended for debugging kickstart components
  that are rendered to the machine via DRP's templating system, or to
  allow an operator to do continuous ESXi kickstart installations for
  testing purposes.
