Name: "esxi/ks-custom-kickstart"
Description: "VMware vSphere ESXi custom kickstart commands to add."
Documentation: |
  This Param allows an operator to create a list of additional "kickstart"
  directives to apply to generated kickstart file. These directives will
  be placed **after** the ``network`` template, but before any other
  ``%pre``, ``%post``, and/or ``%firstboot`` sections.

  If you wish to add additional templates for ``%pre``, ``%post``,
  and/or ``%firstboot`` sections, use the ``esxi/ks-custom-sections`` param.

  Multiple additional templates can be called with kickstart commands
  in them.  Below is an example:

    ::

      # YAML example
      esxi/ks-custom-kickstart:
        - "my-kickstart-1.ks.tmpl"
        - "my-kickstart-2.ks.tmpl"

      # JSON example
      {
        [
          "my-kickstart-1.ks.tmpl",
          "my-kickstart-2.ks.tmpl"
        ]
      }

  .. note: **WARNING** Insure that any commands you enter in your templates are valid kickstart directives.
