Name: esxi/http-mirror
Description: "Set an alternate HTTP mirror path for installing VMware ESXi"
Documentation: |
  This Param lets the operator override the location of the HTTP
  located VMware ESXi installer.  Typically, an operator uses a
  `drpcli bootenvs uploadiso <ISO_NAME>` which causes the ISO image
  to be copied to the DRP Endpoint, and "exploded" out on the TFTP/
  HTTP file serving file system.

  Kickstart installation is served from this location to the installing
  machine.  With use of this Param, the ESXi ISO contents can be
  relocated an altnernate HTTP Mirror which will allow for operator
  control over mirroring, availability, and capacity requirements.

  .. note: You must mirror the structure of the "exploded" ISO content
    exactly, or installation will not be successful.  Typically it is
    best to perform the DRP "uploadiso" operation, and then mirror
    the results of that (found in the `tftpboot` directory on disk).
