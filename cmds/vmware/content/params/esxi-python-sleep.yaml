Description: Set a number of seconds to sleep in Python code prior to Firewall transitions
Documentation: |
  Sets a number of seconds to sleep in python code, after making a Firewall transition
  change.  On some hardware (eg. HPE Moonshot cartridges), there may be a timing issue
  that requires a temporary sleep to allow the firewall changes to "settle".

  The default value is 0 seconds (no sleep) if not otherwise specified, and can range
  from 0 to a maximum of 300 seconds. Partial second values are allowed (eg ``.300``
  for 300 microseconds).
