Name: "esxi/ks-custom-sections"
Description: "VMware vSphere ESXi custom kickstart configurations to apply."
Documentation: |
  This Param allows an operator to create a list of additional Templates
  to include during the ESXi kickstart installation phase.  Kicstarts support
  three additional installation phases supported by this Param:

    - ``%pre``
    - ``%post``
    - ``%firstboot``

  Each phase can use ``busybox`` (shell) or ``python`` interpreter to implement
  customizations. This results in the "phase" types that you can set as follows:

    - ``pre-busybox``
    - ``pre-python``
    - ``post-busybox``
    - ``post-python``
    - ``fistboot-busybox``
    - ``fistboot-python``

  .. note: At this time, this tooling does not support the ``%post --nochroot``
    capability.

  To inject custom *kickstart* directives, see the ``esxi/ks-custom-kickstart``
  param.

  Each "phase" has a an array of various templates that can be injected in
  that given phase to build up the Kickstart file.  Below is an example:

    ::

      # YAML example
      esxi/ks-custom-sections:
        pre-busybox:
          - "my-pre-busybox-chunk1.ks.tmpl"
          - "my-pre-busybox-chunk2.ks.tmpl"
        post-python:
          - "my-post-python3-chunk2.ks.tmpl"
        firstboot-busybox:
          - "my-fistboot-busybox-chunk1.ks.tmpl"

      # JSON example
      {
        "firstboot-busybox": [
          "my-fistboot-busybox-chunk1.ks.tmpl"
        ],
        "post-python": [
          "my-post-python3-chunk2.ks.tmpl"
        ],
        "pre-busybox": [
          "my-pre-busybox-chunk1.ks.tmpl",
          "my-pre-busybox-chunk2.ks.tmpl"
        ]
      }

  .. note: **WARNING** for "python" interpreter template types, you must
    insure you use the correct python2 or python3 code for the given
    version of ESXi you are kickstart installing. Don't blame us for that ...
