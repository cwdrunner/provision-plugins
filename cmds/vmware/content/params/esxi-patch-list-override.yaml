Name: esxi/patch-list-override
Description: "Array of patches to apply to ESXi, overriding the programmatically built list"
Documentation: |
  Defines the VMware patches that will be applied to the system.  This value
  will override all construction methods and set the ``esxi/patch-list``
  replacing the ``vmware/esxi-version-vendor-map`` or any other programmatic
  method to build up the list array.

  Generally speaking, the vendor map should be used to select the patches to
  apply to the system.  However, this override exists to allow an operator
  a method to specify precise patches to apply if your vendor map doesn't
  support a patch list.

  In both cases, the ``esxi/patch-map`` must contain a map for the specified
  patches to be applied with appropriate values.

  Pathces are applied in order.  For each patch that specifies a ``reboot-required: true``,
  the system will be rebooted before applying the next patch set.  If not set to ``true``,
  then patches will be applied until the next required reboot is specified.
