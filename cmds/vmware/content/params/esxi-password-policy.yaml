Name: esxi/password-policy
Description: "Default password policy to apply to the esxi host"
Documentation: |
  In ESXI 6 and beyond, the password security policy is controlled
  through the /etc/pam.d/passwd file.

  The default file is specified as the default.  This can
  be replaced by updating this parameter and running the
  **esxi-password-security-policy** task.

  Password strength is specified on the pam_passwdqc.so line.

  * password requisite /lib/security/$ISA/pam_passwdqc.so retry=N min=N0,N1,N2,N3,N4

  Example:

  * password   requisite    /lib/security/$ISA/pam_passwdqc.so retry=3 min=8,8,8,7,6

  The parts are:

  * retry is the number of times a user is prompted for a new password if the password candidate is not sufficiently strong.
  * N0 is the number of characters required for a password that uses characters from only one character class. For example, the password contains only lowercase letters.
  * N1 is the number of characters required for a password that uses characters from two character classes.
  * N2 is used for passphrases. ESXi requires three words for a passphrase. Each word in the passphrase must be 8-40 characters long.
  * N3 is the number of characters required for a password that uses characters from three character classes.
  * N4 is the number of characters required for a password that uses characters from all four character classes.

  For the N(0-3) fields, disabled may be specified to ignore that class type.

  The Password history can also be modify by the following line:

  * password   requisite    /lib/security/$ISA/pam_pwhistory.so use_authtok enforce_for_root retry=2 remember=0

  Adding this line will enforce a number of retries before failure and how often password can be reused.
