Name: esxi/network-firstboot-type

Description: Specifies the post-kickstart network config mode for ESXi node.
Documentation: |
  This Param specifies how the ESXi node should be configured for it's
  network interface post-kickstart.  The supported mode types are:

    =======  ======================================================
    type     notes
    =======  ======================================================
    dhcp     **(default)** requests IP info via DHCP service
    manual   operator provides values via additonal params
    =======  ======================================================

  If set to ``manual`` use the following Params are **required** to configure
  the network:

    ==================================  ===============================================
    param                               notes
    ==================================  ===============================================
    ``esxi/network-firstboot-ipaddr``   sets the IP Address
    ``esxi/network-firstboot-netmask``  sets the subnet Netmask
    ``esxi/network-firstboot-gateway``  sets the Default Gateway
    ==================================  ===============================================

    **WARNING**
      Currently, changing the network type from DHCP will not cause any
      interaction with your DRP Endpoint.  This means that if you use
      ``convert`` to static IP assignment, the DRP endpoint will not be
      aware of this.  You will need to create a :ref:`rs_model_reservation`
      manually to insure your IP assignment isn't stomped on.

      Similarly, if you use ``manual``, it is your responsibility to insure
      you do not map a manual IP assignment to any DHCP ranges, unless you
      also arrange to have that IP assignment converted to a :ref:`rs_model_reservation`
      (when using DRP as the DHCP service).

      Future versions of this plugin should correct this issue.
