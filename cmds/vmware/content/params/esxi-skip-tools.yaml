Name: esxi/skip-tools
Description: Removes the 'tools.t00' module during install
Documentation: |
  If set to ``True``, the ``tools.t00`` module will be removed from
  the modules list at install time of the ESXi node.  Since this module
  is over 155 MB in size, this increases the speed of the install
  and reduces the bandwidth needed to for pulling down the modules.

  This is typically used in a dev/test environment where rapid
  (re)build of ESXi hypervisors is occuring, or in environments
  where the Guest tools are staged in an alternate location, or
  injected in to prebuilt images.

  .. note:  Removing the tools may have an impact on installing the
    tools in the Guest VM instances if you have not made other arrangements
    to insure the tools are installed through some other means.
