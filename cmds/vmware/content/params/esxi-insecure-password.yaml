Name: esxi/insecure-password
Description: "Set an insecure cleartext password for the ESXi 'root' account."
Documentation: |
  If specified, defines a HIGHLY INSECURE cleartext password to be
  converted to a SHA512 hash for the 'root' account on an ESXi
  instance.

  Typically, the workflow will get a desired password from a remote
  infrastructure system (password manager, vault, etc.) as an API
  call, and then convert to a SHA512 for the 'root' account.

  .. note: This value can be overridden by the 'esxi/insecure-password-override'.

  .. note: This value overrides the random generate request param.  If there
    is a value set, then ignore 'esxi/generate-random-password'.

  .. note: There is currently no plumbing to get that remote password
    for use in the install.

  .. note: This does NOT treat the password securely.  Future versions
    should specify use of the RackN "enrypted params" feature to protect
    the clear text password value.
