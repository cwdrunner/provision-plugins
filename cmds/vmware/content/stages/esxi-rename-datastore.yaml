Description: "Rename the default 'datastore1' to value in 'esxi/rename-datastore' param."
Documentation: |
  This stage will rename the defautl ``datastore`` on the ESXi node to the value defined
  in the ``esxi/rename-datastore`` param.

  In addition, the value of ``esxi/rename-datastore`` will be assigned to the param
  ``esxi/install-datastore`` to insure any subsequent tasks are correctly referening
  the newly updated datastore name.

  This **must** be run in the firstboot or post-install booted environment of an ESXi
  host.  It can not run during the kickstart stage of the install.
