Description: Render the in-subnet-check.py.tmpl template to Machine
Documentation: |
  This stage will render the template named ``in-subnet-check.py.tmpl`` to
  the local ESXi filesystem as ``/tmp/in-subnet-check.py`` for use by the
  system.  The task will also set the rendered python file executable.

  To call and use the python file, ensure ``python3`` is found by ``env``,
  and simply call it as ``/tmp/in-subnet-check.py <OPTIONS>``.

  See the Task ``in-subnet-check-validate`` to use it.
