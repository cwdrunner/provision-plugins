Name: "vmware-esxi-set-password"
Description: "Insecurely set a root PW on ESXi, or randomly generate one"
Documentation: |
  This task allows the operator to set an insecure cleartext password
  value, which will be converted to a SHA512 hash for the machine admin
  password to be set to.

  Alternatively, a unique randomly generated password can be created using
  the 'esxi/generate-random-password' param set to 'true'.

  .. note: This is considered HIGHLY INSECURE as the cleartext password value is
    recorded on the Machine object in the 'esxi/insecure-password' param.
