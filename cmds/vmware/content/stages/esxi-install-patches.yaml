Name: "esxi-install-patches"
Description: "Stage to install patches for an ESXi node"
Documentation: |
  This stage installs the patches contained in the ``esxi/patch-list`` array.
  The list is created by the ``esxi-set-patch-list`` stage.
  It is possible that other programmatic methods can be used to generate
  the ``esxi/patch-list``, in which case, the ``esxi-set-patch-list`` stage
  is not necessary.

  The patches specified in ``esxi/patch-list`` must be represented in the
  ``esxi/patch-map``, which is used to reference the actual patch file,
  and it's checksum.
