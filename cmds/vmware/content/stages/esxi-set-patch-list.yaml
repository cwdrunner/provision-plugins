Name: "esxi-set-patch-list"
Description: "Stage to set the patch list for an ESXi node"
Documentation: |
  This stage sets ultimately sets the ``esxi/patch-list`` array to a
  list of patches.  The list is defined by the ``esxi/patch-list-override``,
  or the set of pathes specified in the ``vmware/esxi-version-vendor-map``.
  It is possible that other programmatic methods can be used to generate
  the ``esxi/patch-list``, in which case, this stage is not necessary.

  The patches specified in ``esxi/patch-list`` must be represented in the
  ``esxi/patch-map``, which is used to reference the actual patch file,
  and it's checksum.

  This stage must run in Sledgehammer.
