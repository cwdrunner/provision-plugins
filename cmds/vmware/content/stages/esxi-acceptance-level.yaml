Name: "esxi-acceptance-level"
Description: "Stage to set the patch list for an ESXi node"
Documentation: |
  This task will set ESXi node software VIB install acceptanceLevel.  NOTE
  that as per VMware defined policies and behavior, you may NOT set the
  acceptanceLevel to a level any higher than the lowest level install software
  VIB package.

  Currently, the RackN DRP-Agent and DRP-Firewall-Ruleset VIBs require that the
  acceptanceLevel be set at ``CommunitySupported``.  If these components are
  installed (as they are by default) you will not be able to raise the level.

  The default value is ``CommunitySupported``.  The supported values are (from
  highest to lowest):

    * VMwareCertified
    * VMwareAccepted
    * PartnerSupported
    * CommunitySupported
