Name: vmware-esxi-selector
Description: "Install a selected VMware ESXi version on the system."
Documentation: |
  This workflow implements the automatic ESXi install based on the hardware
  vendor of the machine (if ``vmware/esxi-version`` set to ``select-vendor``),
  and the map Param values from ``vmware/esxi-version-vendor-map``.

  You can also manually force a specific VMware ESXi BootEnv to be installed
  by setting the Param ``vmware/esxi-version`` to a specific supported BootEnv.
  If the Param is set to ``select-vendor``, then the BootEnv will be
  selected based on the map listed above.  You may specify your own map to
  override the default mapped Vendor to ESXi BootEnv version; however, you
  can only map currently supported Vendors found in the ``esxi-version-selector.tmpl``

  New vendor ISOs can be added to the system as BootEnv and ``boot.cfg``
  templates using the ``make-esxi-bootenv.sh`` script found in your DRP Endpoint's
  ``tftpboot`` directory.  For full details please see the VMware content
  documentation found at:
