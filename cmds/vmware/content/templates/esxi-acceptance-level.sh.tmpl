# set the ESXi software VIB install acceptance level

###
#  NOTES:
#
#         The acceptanceLevel can not be set any higher that the LOWEST
#         level of software VIB installed.  For DRP-Agent and DRP-FirewallRuleset
#         installed, this means the acceptanceLevel MUST be set to CommunitySupported.
#
#         In the future, get the installed software VIB levels currently on the system:
#         localcli software vib list | tail +3 | awk ' { print $3 } ' | sort -u
#
#         Assign them a value of 1, 2, 3, 4 for the high to low levels:
#             VMwareCertified
#             VMwareAccepted
#             PartnerSupported
#             CommunitySupported
#
#         Check the current level (returns one of the above strings):
#         localcli software acceptance get
#
#         Determine if the level is changeable to the level the Operator requested, based
#         on the LOWEST level of currently installed software.  If not - handle error
#         appropriately.
###

# if the operator installs a level higher than lowest level installed software, this
# command WILL FAIL - until the above rules in NOTES are implemented
localcli software acceptance set --level {{ .Param "esxi/acceptance-level" }}
