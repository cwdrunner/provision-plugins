Name: raid-skip-encryption
Description: Whether to skip RAID encryption configuration
Documentation: |
  The `raid-skip-encryption` flag, when true, will cause the
  configuration encryption taks to be skipped.

  This allows the system to know when encryption has been configured
  and should be skipped to keep disks in a functioning state.

  The `raid-reset` stage will clear this flag to allow for reconfiguration.

Schema:
  type: boolean
  default: false
