The bios plugin allows you to get and set BIOS configuration parameters on server systems
from the following manufacturers:

* Dell, which requires the ``dell-support`` content bundle.
* HPE, which requires the ``hpe-support`` content bundle.
* Lenovo, which requires the ``lenovo-support`` content bundle.

In all cases, bios configuration management is implemented as a set of tasks
designed to be run in the Sledgehammer boot environment.
