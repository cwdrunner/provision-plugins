Description: "The Lenovo batch configuration files to apply to the system"
Documentation: |
  This is a list of strings (to be files) to apply to the system through onecli in batch mode.

  If a line contains --file=<file> or --file <file>, the system will attempt to make sure that file is
  present and, if not present, retrieve it from the `bios-file-base-url` location.  Paths are maintained.
