Name: "ipmi/force-protocol"
Description: "Force the system to use IPv4 or IPv6"
Documentation: |
  This parameter can be used to force a choice on IPv4 or IPv6.  By default, the system will
  attempt to choose between IPv4 or IPv6 by the presence of a default gateway.  If IPv6 has a
  default gateway, it will be preferred, otherwise IPv4 is prefered.

  Setting this parameter will force the path.  It could lead to DRP not be able to connect to the BMC.

  The parameter defaults to unset.
