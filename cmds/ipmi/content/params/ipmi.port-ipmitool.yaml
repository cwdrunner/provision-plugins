Name: "ipmi/port-ipmitool"
Description: "Network Port for the IPMI interface."
Documentation: |
  This parameter is used by the IPMI Plugin to access the BMC.

  This parameter can be set to define the Port on which the IPMI
  controller is listening.  The default value is ``0``, which means
  no port number will be passed through to the tooling.

  The default port used by the IPMI protocol is ``623``.  If the IPMI
  protocol services are relocated to a different port number, then
  this value needs to be updated.

Schema:
  type: "integer"
